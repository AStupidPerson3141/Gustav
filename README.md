## description
Gustav is an AI powered drone, which will follow the user like a sort of pet. It's designed for:
- Raspberry pi (preferably 5)
- BLDC motors (so 3phase motors)
though I hope that we can generalize that at some point (so it runs more efficient for cheaper raspberry pis, and can use two phase motors)


## features
right now we are working on:
- simple hovering of the drone
- the recognizer, that will recognize objects and the user
- a debugger to display usefull information (like what direction it wants to go)


## bugs
currently zero (as no features are available)


## else
the project is open to contributers
